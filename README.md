- word2vec

This repository contains code and results for a novel moethod to enrich the word embeddings of a word in a sentence with its surrounding context using a biderectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). 

# Usage
- tf (model, cnn, alt_ver)
- tflearn

# Results
- standard comparision w cnn
- different datasets
- tf and tflearn results
- make word embs static

# Ideas
- gru instead of lstm
- visualizing
- cross validation
